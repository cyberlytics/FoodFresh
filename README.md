# 1. Introduction

FoodFresh is a decentralized supply chain consortium that supports interoperability and controlled transparency in a 
heterogeneous, blockchain-enabled supply chain network. It enables divergent types of consensus systems to interoperate 
in a decentralized federation, allowing public and private blockchains to have controllable access to each other.

# 4. Build

Install Rust with toolchain:

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
rustup toolchain install nightly-2020-08-23
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly-2020-08-23
```

You may need additional dependencies, checkout [substrate.io](https://docs.substrate.io/v3/getting-started/installation) for more info.

Install Node.js:

```bash
curl "https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/node-${VERSION:-$(wget -qO- https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/ | sed -nE 's|.*>node-(.*)\.pkg</a>.*|\1|p')}.pkg" > "$HOME/Downloads/node-latest.pkg" && sudo installer -store -pkg "$HOME/Downloads/node-latest.pkg" -target "/"
```

# 4.1 Relay Tier
The relay chain, in the relay tier, is the central hub in the network of 
heterogeneous blockchains, the parachains. The relay chain provides parachains
(owner by organizations) with parachain block validation and allows them to 
communicate with each other using the XCM format for cross-chain messaging.

__Note__: Compiling this project is a resource intensive process! Use a machine with no less than:

- 8 GB of RAM (16 GB is suggested)
- 4 CPU cores (8 cores are suggested)
- 50 GB of free HDD/SSD space

Without the minimal RAM here, you are likely run out of memory resulting in a `SIGKILL` error during the compilation process.

Clone and build [Polkadot](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot) (beware of the version tag we used):

```bash
git clone -b v0.9.7 --depth 1 https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot.git
cd polkadot
cargo build --release
```

### Start Relay Chain

We need *n + 1* full _validator_ nodes running on a relay chain to accept *n* parachain connections.

- Start Relay `Alice` node

  ```bash
  ./target/release/polkadot \
  --chain ./rococo_local.json \
  -d /tmp/relay/alice \
  --validator \
  --alice \
  --port 50555
  ```

- Start Relay `Charlie` node:

  ```bash
  ./target/release/polkadot \
  --chain ./rococo_local.json \
  -d /tmp/relay/charlie \
  --validator \
  --charlie \
  --port 50556
  ```

- Add more relay chain nodes as needed.

# 4.2 Application Tier 
The application tier encapsulates the business logic in the collator node. The business logic is decomposed into 
the following FRAME pallets:

The rbac pallet maintains an on-chain registry of roles and the users to which those roles are assigned. 
A role is a tuple with the name of a pallet and a permission that qualifies the level of access granted by the role. 
A permission is an enum with the variants Execute and Manage. The Execute permission allows a user to invoke a pallet's 
dispatchable functions. The Manage permission allows a user to assign and revoke roles for a pallet and also implies the 
Execute permission. Access control validation is done within the transaction pool validation by way of the RBAC pallet's 
Authorize signed extension. Therefore, permissions are configured in the chain specification file.  

The registrar inherits DID capabilities from the did pallet and uses these capabilities to implement an 
organization registry. This pallet maintains a list of organizations and maps each organization to a list of members. 
Organizations are identified by the account ID that registered it. 
They are also associated with a name, which is designated by the value of the Org attribute on the did of the 
organization owner. Organization owners are the only accounts that may add members to their organizations. 
When an account is added to an organization as a member, the organization owner creates an OrgMember delegate for the 
member's did. In this way, the organization owner can certify an account's membership in the organization.
The registrar pallet exposes a custom origin, EnsureOrg, that validates whether or not an account owns or is a member of 
at least one organization. The EnsureOrg origin is used to control access to many of the chain's capabilities, 
including the ability to create roles with the rbac pallet.

The documentRegistry pallet uses proof of existence. 
Instead of storing the original document in the blockchain, only a hash value generated by the web frontend, 
a proof that the document exists, is stored. 
This requires (i) a user, (ii) a file hash (or file digest), and (iii) the timestamp of the verification. 
Before a document is registered, the digest is compared to all stored document digests to ensure that the same document 
can be registered at most once. 
The runtime storage is only modified after all checks are completed. 
This is important because if the transaction fails at some later point, the storage is modified and will remain so.

The productRegistry provides functionality for registering products (also known as trade items) exchanged in a 
supply chain among various stakeholders. A product owner (i.e., a member of an organization) registers product data in 
the system to be visible for other supply chain participants. 
The productRegistry maintains a registry of products, which maps each product to the organization it belongs. 
On successful registration, the productRegistry assigns a unique ID to the registered product for systemwide 
identification. The origin trait EnsureOrg is used to control the accounts that are allowed to create products.

The ProductTracking pallet provides functionality for tracking shipments. 
One can monitor the storage and transportation conditions for a shipment along the supply chain. 
Shipments are associated with an organization and have an assigned ID. 
This pallet supports tracking several types of shipping events: registration, pickup, scan, and delivery. 
With the exception of registration, shipment events may be associated with a list of sensor readings. 
For instance, the operations manager registers a shipment, and the `ShipmentStatus` turns to "pending." 
When the company transport operator tracks the pickup operation, the `ShipmentStatus` turns to "in transit." 
During the transport, multiple scan operations can occur, but the `ShipmentStatus` does not change. 
Finally, when a shipment arrives at its destination, the transport operator can track a delivery operation, 
and the `ShipmentStatus` turns to "delivered." To communicate with the outside world about the product tracking and 
conditions, the collator node architecture is extended with an OCW subsystem. 
Shipment events are placed in a queue that is monitored by an OCW. 
When events appear in this queue, the OCW sends them to an off-chain service via a REST API.

- Run the Off-Chain Worker (OCW) listener to receive OCW notifications.

  ```bash
  cd offchain
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python ocw.py [--host=localhost --port=3005]
  ```

- Run the Parachain collator

  ```bash
  cd multichain/parachain-collator
  cargo +nightly-2020-08-23 build --release
  ```

# 4.3 Presentation Tier
The presentation tier encompasses the web frontend and a Web3 browser extension.
The web frontend is built with NodeJS and uses the Polkadot JavaScript client library to interact and query the 
application tier nodes. The capabilities that the client library expose are implemented on top of the substrate RPC API.

- Launch the web frontend

  ```bash
  cd frontend
  yarn install && yarn start
  ```

# 5. Testing

The testing strategy for FoodFresh is twofold:

### 5.1 Unit testing 

Unit tests cover small scale correctness tests of individual pallets and their functions.

Testing a pallet requires a mock runtime which can be found in `mock.rs`.
Test cases for a pallet are defined in `test.rs`. To run the tests use `cargo test`.

### 5.2 XCM Testing 

The evaluation of cross-chain messages suggests that the focus should be rather on finding macroscopic variables to 
capture the full system rather than microscopic variables concerning a single parachain. 
By adapting the perspective of fluid dynamics, observing a network of blockchains from a monitor, one can see the 
movement of cross-chain transfers as fluid.

- Run the script

  ```bash
  cd evaluation
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python xcm.py [ump, hrmp, monitor] # ump and hrmp can be used to manually submit XCMs
  ```
